	Text Feature Extraction Techniques
---------------------------------------------------
@Introduction:
	This is all of what we have gathered from different sources. Introduced some common 
	techniques for extracting and processing data of text, listing some outstanding 
	features of "scikit-learn" library. The results from the examples have made it easier
	to understand how textual data mining is.

@SourceCode: Demo by Python3 about 4 class in subsmodule "sklearn.feature_extraction.text"
